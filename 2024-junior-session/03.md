# Debugging
## Why?
- No more `[Object object]`
- Can inspect deeply, including third-party library like weird mongoose model
- Update values on the fly to see different behaviors

## Demonstration
- [Easy ad revenue](https://www.onlineconversion.com/length_common.htm)

## Panels
- Breakpoints
- Variables
  - Watch
- Stack

## Actions
- Resume
- Step in/out/over
- Disconnect

## Tips
- Pause on uncaught exception

## Caveats
- Accidental memory update
  - What you put in the `watch` panel will be executed and manipulate memory(value), and you might get weird behavior.
- Timing issue/Async operation
  - You might interfere the order of execution by pausing program at certain point, and this might cause an unexpected behavior
    ```ts
      let asdf = { 'foo': 'bar' };

      // Note that we don't await here
      asyncFunctionUpdatingAsdf();

      // Now this could have updated asdf because we've waited for the other thread to complete the function above
    > cosole.log(asdf);
    ```
  - Also you might unveil obscure behavior like not `await`ing `Promise` accidentally
