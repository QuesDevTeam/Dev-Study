# Debugging
## Why?
- No more `[Object object]`
- Can inspect deeply, including third-party library like weird mongoose model
- Update values on the fly to see different behaviors

## Panels
- Breakpoints
  - Mark where you want to stop
  - Line which does not actually compute anything won't be effective, rather it'll stop at the next line
- Variables
  - Variables you can access from current scope
  - You might need to check several `scopes` to see variable you're looking for
- Watch
  - You can manually enter expressions to watch
  - See `Accidental memory update` under [caveats](#caveats)
- Stacks
  - You can see and jump between call stacks
  - This can be helpful when you need to check variables changing between caller/callee

## Actions
- Resume: resume program until next breakpoint or error
- Step
  - In/Out: Go into/get out of function
  - Over: Execute current line and wait at next line
    - Closure or single-liner could make you stop multiple times
    - Stepping into async function could be confusing. This is possibly due to compiling typescript into javascript.
- Disconnect: Well, disconnect.

## Tips
- Pause on uncaught exception: Good for checking where the error is thrown

## Caveats
- Accidental memory update
  - What you put in the `watch` panel will be executed and manipulate memory(value), and you might get weird behavior.
- Timing issue/Async operation
  - You might interfere the order of execution by pausing program at certain point, and this might cause an unexpected behavior
    ```ts
      let asdf = { 'foo': 'bar' };

      // Note that we don't await here
      asyncFunctionUpdatingAsdf();

      // Now this could have updated asdf because we've waited for the other thread to complete the function above
    > cosole.log(asdf);
    ```
  - Also you might unveil obscure behavior like not `await`ing `Promise` accidentally
